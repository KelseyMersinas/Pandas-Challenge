    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "The data presented here can be used to show that there are several differences between the schools in this district. Out of the 15 schools in this district only 65% of students are passing both math and reading. Breaking this down by each school, the lowest scoring school, Rodriguez High at 52% passing, and the highest, Cabrera High with 91% passing, show about a 39 percent difference in students overall passing both math and reading.\r\n",
    "Breaking this data down by school type, charter schools have an overall passing of 90% of their students, with district schools at only 53%. When sorting each school by overall passing, charter schools represent the top five highest passing overall and district schools the bottom five. \r\n",
    "When breaking down by funding per student the data shows that charter schools are typically using less funding on average than district schools. Seven out of the eight charter schools are in the lower half of the four spending categories. Charter schools are using less funding per student yet are achieving higher average scores and a higher passing rate. This data shows that higher spending per student does not increase the likelihood of passing.\r\n",
    "Evaluating schools based on their size shows that small and medium sized schools scored very close, but large schools with 2000 or more students had lower than average passing for both reading and math. Overall small and medium sized schools are very close in overall passing at 89% and 90%, compared to large schools averaging only a 58% passing. \r\n",
    "From this data set the best indicators of student success in schools would be attending a charter school rather than a district school and attending a smaller or medium sized school rather than a large school. \r\n"
